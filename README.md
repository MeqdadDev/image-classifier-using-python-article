Image classification involves categorizing images -an entire image- based on their types or classes, and it serves as a fundamental task in the field of computer vision. This process finds wide-ranging applications in various domains, including object detection, medical diagnosis, security, agriculture, and entertainment.


### Steps for Building Image Classifier

To build an image classifier, you need to walkthrough the following steps:
- Collecting the data (images for each class)
- Training your model (Teachable Machine from Google)
- Testing your results
- Improving and repeat
